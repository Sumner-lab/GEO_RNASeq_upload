# GEO_RNASeq_upload

This page is to simplify the upload of data to GEO (Gene Expression Omnibus), which is the portal in which you can upload raw reads and gene expression counts to NCBI.

Uploading counts and expression data is the standard procedure for RNA-Seq experiments, although if you wish not to upload expression counts, then you can also upload your raw reads directly through SRA (Sequence read archive, on NCBI).

Steps to upload the data.

1. Find your raw counts, and make expression counts, these could be from featureCounts (Nextflow, rnaseq pipeline).
2. Make sure all your raw reads and expression count files are in the same folder. 
3. Copy the excel table in this repo (Multispecies...), which provides a basic template to upload your data.
4.
